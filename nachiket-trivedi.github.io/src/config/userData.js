  myDescription: [
    `I’m a Software Engineer Intern at Evolko where I'm leading the frontend engineering team of one of the 
    company's prime products which focus on enhanced virtual collaboration between doctors and patients to 
    promote social distancing in the post-COVID-19 world. Along with that, I'm also a Graduate Software 
    Engineering Student at San Jose State University where I contributed as a Graduate Research Assistant. 
    Before starting my masters, I was a full-time Software Development Engineer at Deloitte, where I worked on some 
    interesting projects and managed to increase the performance of one by about 40%. Prior to that comes my blissful
 undergrad days where I was the leader of a technical club in addition to being an Undergraduate Researcher 
    at my university for 1.5 years. In that run, by indulging in an all-night coding (and an all-day sleeping :P) 
    routine, I completed an IEEE award-winning personal research project which in turn was published by Springer.`,
    `My recent work reflects my already piqued interest in software development and hence I love (LOVE!) participating
     in hackathons. I completed the 'Opportunity Hack 2019' organized by PayPal at their HQ and was selected by 
     Facebook to participate in the 'FB San Francisco Hackathon' in Nov 2019, and completed that too. Outside of 
     work, I'm obsessed with algorithmic coding, writing English poems, and reading History. Feel free to reach out 
     to me, I love chit-chatting on random topics :D`,
