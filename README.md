# Portfolio-Maker

As tens of thousands of students gear up for the job market in these rather unusual times, they need a strong representation of their profile in form of a portfolio, as every major company expects the same. I myself experienced the situation during my summer internship hunt and just wished there was an easy and efficient way to get the job done, thereby letting me focus more on the interview preparations. During the course of summer, driven by the sheer motivation of contributing something to the community, I developed a Portfolio Maker web application which does just the thing, and I'm happy to make it live today!



The project started as a personal portfolio website for GitHub pages, and gradually transformed into a fully fledged two-tired web application allowing users to create their own portfolios. 

The highlights of the application are as follows:

1) Easy to use and sleek UI.

2) Provides user a 'Create' option to enter their respective details, which are editable.

3) Upon 'Download', the user just have to create an empty GitHub repository and execute the masterscript.sh file, and within 10 minutes, their application is live on their GitHub pages.
